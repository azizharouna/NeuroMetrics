# NeuroMetrics
NeuroMetrics offers AI-driven insights into Parkinson's treatment efficacy. Repository includes preprocessing scripts, ML models, and visualization tools to guide clinical decisions and enhance patient care.

## 1. Problem Definition
- **Objective**: Develop an AI product to assess the efficacy of Parkinson's disease treatments using the AMPÂ®PD dataset.
- **Key Metrics**: MDS-UPDR scores, NPX, peptide abundances, and associated clinical data.

## 2. Data Pre-processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- **Data Integration**: Merge datasets using unique identifiers (`visit_id`, `patient_id`).
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like duration since diagnosis and rate of MDS-UPDR score change.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examine MDS-UPDR scores, NPX, and peptide abundances.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Study MDS-UPDR scores over time for different treatments.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify proteins or peptides correlated with MDS-UPDR scores.

## 4. Hypothesis Testing
- **Treatment Effect**: Test for significant differences in MDS-UPDR scores among treatments.
- **Protein & Peptide Influence**: Test if specific proteins or peptides influence outcomes.

## 5. Model Development
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features based on importance.
- **Model Selection**: 
- **Model Validation**: Use cross-validation for performance.

## 6. Interpretation & Visualization
- **Feature Importance**: Identify influential features.
- **Visualization**: Develop dashboards for patient progression and treatment efficacy.

## 7. Deployment & Monitoring
- **API Development**: Convert the model into an API for healthcare systems.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor and recalibrate the model.

## 8. Feedback Loop
- **Clinical Feedback**: Get feedback from healthcare professionals.
- **Continuous Learning**: Update the model with new data.

## 9. Ethical Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure patient data privacy.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Check for biases in the model.

## 10. Documentation & Reporting
- **Model Documentation**: Document model details.
- **Reporting**: Create periodic performance reports.
